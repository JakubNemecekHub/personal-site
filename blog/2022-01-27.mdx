We had another potential buyers visitig, so now our flat can be described as hastily cleaned.

I think, though I am not absolutely sure, that gatsby web page can only read data from database or filesystem, but cannot create any new data. Should investigate.

In the meantime I could pursue an idea the realization above lead me to. Create a Django app, that can do everything this gatsby web page can and more. In the end, they would use the same databases. And Django could be uset to create and edit items in these databases. Two birds with one stone.

Also a need for some kind of pagination or filtering of data loaded from GraphiQL is becoming urgent.
