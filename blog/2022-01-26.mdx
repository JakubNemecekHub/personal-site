Today is Juli's birthday. Hooray.

Yesterday evening a managed to break something in my previous site. The problem occured after installin a gatsby plugin *gatsby-theme-gallery*. After that I got an error concerning another npm module (Sharp, if I recollect). I wans't able to find any solution, so now we are here. In new gatsby project.

I will now use git, even though I am not sure if it would help me with such problem.

Also, my eyes would welcome a night mode.
