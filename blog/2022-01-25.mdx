Trying to create yet another web page of mine. This time using JS Gatsby. Don't know much about it, but the tutorial was helpful and easy to copy. This time I have at least a tiny and more or less specific idea about the page's contens. It will be my personal site, containing info about my skills and hobbies.

To try out the mark-up list:
* Skills
* Projects
* Books
* Ties
* Photos
* And - I strongly believe - many more

For my next endeavour:
* Create a sticky footer. For example:
    * https://dev.to/mokkapps/sticky-footer-in-gatsbyjs-using-flexbox-5162
    * https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-layout/
* Figure out a way to make the link of active page to be highlighted by a specific color

For more distant future
* A form to create and edit these posts. Is it even feasable?
